# google-homepage
In this project I begin my journey in Web development recreating the Google
homepage using HTML and CSS.

# The Odin Project
This is the first project following the Odin Project curriculum. The objective
is to recreate the google home page using our current knowledge and by
applying what we've learned into this.

# My Thoughts...
This has been a very fun and difficult project for me, but very rewarding!
I did a lot of trial and error progress, especially with the footer...

# Things to improve
I realize that I'm just starting out... There are lots of things I couldn't
figure out how to do in this project like adding the search icon inside the
search area and how to properly highlight the "more apps" button at the top when
you hover over it.

I never wrote a README.md file before and I'm not used to writing up information
in this way. This is something I want to really improve as well!

I've got lots to learn, I plan on returning to this project as I get further
into my learning.
